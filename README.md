A game inspired by the Hero Defense subgenre.

## Gameplay

Defend your base against waves of monsters. Control a hero, roam the map, recruit more defenders, level up, hold the line for 20 minutes.

## How to run the game

For now it can't be properly called a game, so there are no builds. Opening the project in Godot and running it should work.

Making it playable is the top priority right now, but the progress is pretty slow.

## Comment

This is mostly a learning project which will hopefully turn into a serious game. I'm learning:

1. Godot (after using programming-based frameworks like LOVE and Kaboom)
2. How to make a non-Ludum-Dare-sized game
3. How to manage a GitHub project
