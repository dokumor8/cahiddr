A game inspired by the Hero Defense subgenre.

## Gameplay

Defend your base against waves of monsters. Control a hero, roam the map, recruit more defenders, level up, hold the line for 20 minutes.

## How to run the game

The game is at an early prototype stage, everything (art, gameplay) is temporary placeholders.

Controls:

- WASD: move camera
- Right click: move / attack
- Left click: select unit (does nothing, only shows HP, you only control a single unit)
- B: build mode (same as the UI button). A building costs 200 resources and spawns allied defenders.

The "rally point" UI button lets you move the rally points of all buildings to a new spot.

Enemy units come from the right and attack your base. Protect the orange unit - "King".


## Comment

This is mostly a learning project which will hopefully turn into a serious game. I'm learning:

1. Godot (after using programming-based frameworks like LOVE and Kaboom)
2. How to make a non-Ludum-Dare-sized game
3. How to manage a GitHub project
